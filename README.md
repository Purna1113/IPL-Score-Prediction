# IPL-Score-Prediction
This project predicts IPL cricket innings scores using a neural network and an interactive interface. It uses match features (venue, teams, striker, bowler) with label encoding and scaling. Users select inputs via widgets, and the model predicts the score, displaying a random image of the selected team for enhanced experience.
